## HashMap
Dictionaries are an example of hash maps. Hash maps are essentially computing an index with a key into an array of buckets or slots. Its value is mapped to the bucket with the corresponding index

The hash map design will include the following functions:
```
set_val(key, value): Inserts a key-value pair into the hash map. If the value already exists in the hash map, update the value.
get_val(key): Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or “No record found” if this map contains no mapping for the key.
delete_val(key): Removes the mapping for the specific key if the hash map contains the mapping for the key.
```
