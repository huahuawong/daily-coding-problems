### Stack
Stack is LIFO (Last In First Out). Think of it as stacking things on top of one another. The first element in would be at the bottom, thus last one getting retrieved.

Stack in Python
1. size: returns the size of the stack
2. append: add elements to the stack
3. pop: returns the top most element


### Queues
Queue is FIFO (First In First Out). Think of it as lining up, the first one in line would be the first one to get out of the queue.

Queue in Python
1. Enqueue: add an element into the queue
2. Deque: remove an element from the queue based on the order that the element are inserted
