Decided to try out the one-year-plan to crack the SWE assessments introduced by Anjali Virgama, the link to the article can be accessed here: https://towardsdatascience.com/the-one-year-plan-for-competitive-coding-6af53f2f719c

This decision was made as I wanted to brush up my coding knowledge and practice solving them quickly. I realized that there are times where I know I could solve the problem, but it took longer than expected
as I need to spend time debugging them. The best way to speed up the process? Practice, practice and practice.
