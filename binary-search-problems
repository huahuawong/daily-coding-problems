#1 Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Recap, BST means nodes to the left is lower than the root value, nodes to the right has higher value than root value
To validate a BST, first set a lower bound and an upper bound, let's call it floor and ceiling respectively.
We know that the left node is smaller than the root value, so its range would be from negative infinity to the root value
Same thing for the right node, ranging from root value to positive infinity.
As long as when the function checks each node and the left and right nodes are in their respective range, it'd be valid.

def isValidBST(root, floor=float('-inf'), ceiling=float('inf')):
        if not root: 
            return True
        if root.val <= floor or root.val >= ceiling:
            return False
            
    # in the left branch, root is the new ceiling; contrarily root is the new floor in right branch
        return isValidBST(root.left, floor, root.val) and isValidBST(root.right, root.val, ceiling)

#2 Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

    left, right = 0, len(target) -1
    while left <= right:

            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
