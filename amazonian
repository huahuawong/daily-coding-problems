#1 Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome.

For example, carrace should return true, since it can be rearranged to form racecar, which is a palindrome. 
daily should return false, since there's no rearrangement that can form a palindrome.

NO_OF_CHARS = 256

def canformPalindrone(st):
    # Create a count array and initialize
    # all values as 0
    count = [0] * NO_OF_CHARS

    # For each character in input strings,
    # increment count in the corresponding
    # count array
    for i in range(0, len(st)):

    # a little confusing but basically we count the characteres to check
    # if there is more than one odd values, cause if there is, then palindrone can;t be formed

    # Count odd occurring characters
