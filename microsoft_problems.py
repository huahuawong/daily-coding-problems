# Given an array of numbers and a number k, determine if there are three entries in the array which add up to the specified number k

# We will also be using left and right pointer, left would be i+1, and right is the last element of the array

# Q4
# You are given an string representing the initial conditions of some dominoes. Each element can take one of three values:

#     L, meaning the domino has just been pushed to the left,
#     R, meaning the domino has just been pushed to the right, or
#     ., meaning the domino is standing still.

# Determine the orientation of each tile when the dominoes stop falling. Note that if a domino receives a force from the left and right side simultaneously, 
# it will remain upright. For example, given the string .L.R....L, you should return LL.RRRLLL.
# Basically, the idea is to use 2 array appraoch. First, we initialize an array of zeroes of length n. or the first array, we iterate through the string and determine
# the right positions. If val = "R", then rDist variable = 0, if it's L, then nothing changes, else if rDist is not None, which means R was present prior to that, then
# we'd increment rDist and mark the rDist value at the dist.

# Similar thing is done for the left array, except we are iterating from the right to the left. If there is "L", then set lDist = 0, the difference is that right now,
# if lDist is not None, then we have to see if lDist < dist[i] or the current point is a ".", then we assign "L". If lDist == dist[i], that means it was moving "R", and
# that means, they'll be canceled out, thus it will be in "." state
