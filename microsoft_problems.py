# For example, if N = 3, and our integers are [1, 2, 3], there are two ways, shown below.

# Q3
# Given an array of numbers and a number k, determine if there are three entries in the array which add up to the specified number k

# The most straight forward way to do it is to use 3 loops and keep iterating through the numbers, if the sum is found, then return True, but this would result in O(n^3)
# The alternate way is to use 2 pointers, intiialize i from 0 to the array lenghth - 2, minus 2 in this case since we are considering 2 pointers, and the left pointer is i + 1
# We will also be using left and right pointer, left would be i+1, and right is the last element of the array
# Basically for i = 0, it'd be arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[5] (assuming it;s 5 element array), if the sum of these 3 is smaller than the target, then we increment i
