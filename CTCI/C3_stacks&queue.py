# 3.1 Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks

# First, initialise 2 stacks by using the starting elements and ending elements of the array
# Second, define the third stack at the middle of the array
# Redefine push op s.t. when a new element is pushed into a stack, the other stacks will be shifted
